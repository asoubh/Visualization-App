This repo contains code for development of a personal project to build a Tkinter application for analysis and visualization of COVID-19 data pulled from *The COVID Tracking Project API (https://covidtracking.com/data/api/version-2)*.

The code contained in this repo is currently a work in progress, and is largely aimed at demonstraiting my current python skillset.
